# New Version of Content Edit

---

In the old version, we use `markdown` to edit `content`, which is unsupported for image and tables. In the new version, we can automatically use `What You See Is What You Get` to edit `content`, which is more convenient and easy to use.

We make every item an editable part, and make every item can be dragged and dropped to change the order (developing).
